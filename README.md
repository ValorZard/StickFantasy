2D Pixel Arena Fighter made for the I Can't Draw But Want To Make A Game (Again) Jam 2020
ToDo:
Separate dash into its own function for easier debugging
Maybe separate the state machine into its own class also, 
To make the split between the view and model more apparent
Model handles gameplay stuff, view handles engine stuff
Also need to actually make a model of what I want to do
